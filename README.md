# Task
The overall task is to implement and test methods for isolated word recognition:\
• combine phonetic HMMs into word HMMs using a lexicon\
• implement the forward-backward algorithm\
• use it compute the log likelihood of spoken utterances given a Gaussian HMM\
• perform isolated word recognition\
• implement the Viterbi algorithm, and use it to compute Viterbi path and likelihood\
• compare and comment Viterbi and Forward likelihoods\
• implement the Baum-Welch algorithm to update the parameters of the emission probability
